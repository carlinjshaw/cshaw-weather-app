# cshaw-weather-app

This app uses two APIs, along with JQuery and Bootstrap to add some basic styling. 
The first api finds the coordinate of the city, and the second finds the weather information about the city. 
The city name is passed into local storage and then is resent to the weather API if the name is clicked.
